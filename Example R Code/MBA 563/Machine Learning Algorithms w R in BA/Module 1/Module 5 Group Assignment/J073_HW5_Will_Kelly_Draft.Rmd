***Below the plot, identify what variable has the strongest negative correlation with interest_rate. Comment on what might explain why that correlation is negative.

The Variable with the strongest negative correlation is "loan_amount" (-0.33)

The correlation b/t loan amount and interest rates are negative b/c the higher the loan amount the lower the interest rate due to the larger down payment because lenders see a lower level of risk when you have more at stake in the property compared to smaller loan amounts.


# Regress interest rate on Itp
```{r}
lm1 <- lm(interest_rate ~ Itp, data = df)
summary(lm1)
```
***Interpret the coefficient estimate on ltp.

Conclude from lm1 that the coefficient for Itp is -1.05188 which shows a negative coefficient and intercept of 5.31852. 
Also the R squared value is 0.1017 which shows that it is not significantly correlated.   

# Regress interest rate on Itp and loan_amount
```{r}
lm2 <- lm(interest_rate ~ Itp + loan_amount, data = df)
summary(lm2)
```
***Comment on the change in the adjusted R-squared, as well as the change in the coefficient on ltp.

The R Squared value in lm2 improved which is now 0.1522 but not significantly.
The coefficient for Itp is now -0.737 which shows lm2 has an increased correlation.
The coefficient for loan_amount is -0.002 which is a small correlation.


# Regress interest rate on Itp, loan_amount, and aus_1
```{r}
lm3 <- lm(interest_rate ~ Itp + loan_amount + aus_1, data = df)
summary(lm3)
```
***Interpret the new coefficients.

From lm3 we can see that the R squared value increased with stronger correlation (0.2675)
Also in aus_1 the value Desktop Underwriter (DU) is set as the reference.
For coefficients Itp is 0.025007, loan_amount is -0.001714 which is an increase in correlation from the previous models.
In addition from aus_1 there is a strong positive correlation for Not Applicable and Other.
