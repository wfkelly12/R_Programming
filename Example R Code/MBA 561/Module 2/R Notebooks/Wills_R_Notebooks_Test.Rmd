# This is a top level header
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

## This is a second level header

Unordered List:

* List item 1
* List item 2
  + sublist item 1
  
Ordered List:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

Here is a sentence in which we talk about `read.csv()` function

Here is an equation: $NetTotal = \beta_0 + \beta_{1} Quantity + \epsilon$

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r, echo = F}
j17i <- read.csv('jan17Items.csv', stringsAsFactors = T)
summary(j17i)
hist(log(j17i$TotalDue))
```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
